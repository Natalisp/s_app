A Ruby on Rails application organized around REST. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. I used built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. The application supports cross-origin resource sharing, allowing to interact securely with the API from a client-side web application(for the code presentation purpose authentication was simplified). JSON is returned by all API responses.

Version:
The current version of the API is v1, the version is NOT part of the URL, so all calls to the API not necessarily include the API version.
