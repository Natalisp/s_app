The API is organized around REST. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. The application supports cross-origin resource sharing, allowing to interact securely with the API from a client-side web application(for the presentation purpose authentication was simplified). JSON is returned by all API responses.
